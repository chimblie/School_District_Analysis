# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this assignment was to assist Maria, the chief data scientist for a city school district, to analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores and to aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. 
In doing so, I started by importing the CSV file and creating a path. 
import pandas as pd 
import os
path = "Users\estel\Downloads"
mypath = os.path.join('c:\\',path,'new_full_student_data.csv')
student_df = pd.read_csv(mypath)
print(student_df.head()). 

From there, I was able to get the first 5 set of the data. After I got my dataset, I prepared and cleaned the data by removing all the NaN values, removing all duplicated rows, removed the “th” suffix from the grade columns by using the “str” and replace function. Finally, I changed the grade column into “int” type as it shows in the figure below.
student_df = student_df.dropna()
student_df = student_df.drop_duplicates()
student_df["grade"] = student_df["grade"].str.replace("th","”)

student_df["grade"] = student_df["grade"].astype("int64")
student_df.dtypes
student_id         int64
student_name      object
grade              int64
school_name       object
reading_score    float64
math_score       float64
school_type       object
school_budget      int64
dtype: object

Following the steps above, I summarized the statistic of the dataFrame using the describe function, and displayed mean of the math_ score and stored the minimum reading_score in the “min_reading_score”. Also, I needed to display the grade column and the first three rows of Columns 3, 4, and 5 by using the “loc” and “iloc” respectively. These are the codes that I used for each function.
from statistics import mean
student_df.describe()
mean(student_df["math_score"]) 	64.6757332614119

min_reading_score = student_df["reading_score"].min()		10.5


Finally, I was able to compare the data. I compared the data from the average budget for each school type as well as their mean.
student_df.groupby("school_type").mean().loc[:,["school_budget"]].	 This is the result
	school_budget
school_type	
Charter	872625.656236
Public	911195.558251
The amazing thing that I discovered, is the fact that with jupyter notebook we can sort our dataset  and choose and pick what row or column we to display. The perfect example is the figure below. I was able to find the average of the math score from the two types pf schools and grouped them by grades.
student_df.groupby(by=["school_type","grade"])["math_score"].mean().round()


school_type  grade
Charter      9        70.0
             10       66.0
             11       68.0
